# Damien Hirst-Inspired Dot Painting with Python

This Python project creates an abstract dot painting inspired by Damien Hirst's style. The program uses the turtle graphics library to generate a painting made up of colorful dots. The colors are extracted from an image and applied to the dots. The turtle moves across the screen, drawing a series of dots to create a grid-like pattern.

- In this Project I learned how to import a module (other than random)

- I learned how to use the Documentations (and how to draw with turtles!)
