# Damien Hirst-Inspired Dot Painting with Python

This Python project creates an abstract dot painting inspired by Damien Hirst's style. The program uses the turtle graphics library to generate a painting made up of colorful dots. The colors are extracted from an image and applied to the dots. The turtle moves across the screen, drawing a series of dots to create a grid-like pattern.

- In this Project I learned how to import a module (other than random)

- I learned how to use the Documentations (and how to draw with turtles!)

## How It Works

- The program uses colorgram to extract 10 prominent colors from the provided image (dot painting.jpg).
- The turtle graphics library is used to draw dots on the screen. The turtle picks random colors from the extracted palette to paint the dots.
- The dots are arranged in rows, with a small gap between each dot, forming a grid-like pattern.

## How to Run

- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

- Install the required libraries using pip if necessary.

- Place the dot painting.jpg file in the same directory as the script (or modify the file path in the code).

- Run the Million_Dollar_Painting.py script:

bash
Copy code
python Million_Dollar_Painting.py.py
- The painting will appear in a turtle graphics window. Click on the window to close it when you're done.
